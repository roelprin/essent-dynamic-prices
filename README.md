# Essent Dynamic Prices for Home Assistant

![Essent Dynamic Prices](images/logo.svg)

A Home Assistant custom integration for Essent dynamic energy prices.

This integration reads Essent's public dynamic pricing endpoint and exposes current electricity, gas and hourly price data in Home Assistant.

> Status: active development. This is not an official Essent integration.

> Upgrading from experimental v1/v2 builds? v3.1.1 removes obsolete experimental entities automatically during startup.

## Installation via HACS

1. Open **HACS**.
2. Go to **Integrations**.
3. Open the three-dot menu.
4. Choose **Custom repositories**.

## Manual installation

Copy this folder:

```text
custom_components/essent_dynamic
```

to:

```text
/config/custom_components/essent_dynamic
```

Restart Home Assistant.

## Dashboard example

Install **ApexCharts Card** through HACS and use the `Uurprijzen` sensor attributes to draw today and tomorrow price charts.

Example:

```yaml
type: custom:apexcharts-card
header:
  show: true
  title: Essent stroomprijzen vandaag
graph_span: 24h
span:
  start: day
now:
  show: true
  label: Nu
series:
  - entity: sensor.essent_dynamic_prices_uurprijzen
    name: Vandaag
    type: column
    data_generator: |
      const data = entity.attributes.today || [];
      return data.map((item) => {
        return [new Date(item.start).getTime(), item.price];
      });
apex_config:
  yaxis:
    decimalsInFloat: 3
    title:
      text: €/kWh
```

If your entity is named differently, replace the entity ID.

## Notes about tomorrow prices

Tomorrow's electricity prices are only available after Essent publishes them. Until then, the `tomorrow` attribute is empty and `tomorrow_summary` contains null values.

## Energy advice

Since v3.3.0 the integration includes an `Energy advies` sensor.

It gives a short actionable recommendation, for example:

- Good moment to use electricity
- Wait until the cheapest hour
- Current market price is negative
- This is the most expensive hour, postpone large loads

The sensor also exposes attributes for dashboards and automations.
